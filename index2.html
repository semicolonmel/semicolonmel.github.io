							<p>Anna-Lou Leibovitz was born on October 2, 1949, in Waterbury, Connecticut. One of six children born to Sam, an Air Force lieutenant, and Marilyn Leibovitz, a modern dance instructor. In 1967, Leibovitz enrolled at the San Francisco Art Institute, where (although initially studying painting) she developed a love for photography.<br><br> In 1970, she applied for a job with the start-up rock music magazine Rolling Stone. During her time at Rolling Stone Leibovitz was the chief photographer for some of her stellar photos, which included an image of counter-culture icon Allen Ginsberg, Bette Midler, and a nude John Lennon curled around his fully clothed wife, Yoko Ono.<br><br> In 1983, Leibovitz left Rolling Stone and began working for Vanity Fair. With a wider array of subjects, Leibovitz’s photographs for the magazine ranged from presidents to literary icons to teen heartthrobs. Some of Vanity Fair’s iconic covers included Demi Moore (very pregnant and very nude), Whoopi Goldberg (half-submerged in a bathtub of milk), Sylvester Stallone (appearing nude in a pose inspired by Rodin’s “The Thinker”) and Catilyn Jenner (in a corset after having publicly revealed her identity as a woman)<br><br> In 1991, Leibovitz’s collection of more than 200 photographs were exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. She was the first woman to be so honored. Later that year, a book was published to accompany the show titled Photographs: Annie Leibovitz, 1970-1990. In 1996, Leibovitz worked as the official photographer of the Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. A compilation of her black-and-white portraits of American athletes, including Carl Lewis and Michael Johnson, were published in the book Olympic Portraits.</p>
